<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Who I Am<br/>
 Hi! I’m Omar, and I'm a beginner who has just started exploring the world of web development. I'm curious, creative, and excited to learn how websites are built and how they work behind the scenes. Even though I’m just starting out, I’m eager to grow my skills step by step and build something meaningful with code..</p>

<p>I enjoy experimenting with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to create basic webpages. Right now, I'm learning the fundamentals—how to structure a page, style it, and maybe even add a little interactivity. Every small project I work on teaches me something new, and that’s what keeps me motivated.</p>

<p>Why It Works<br/>
In the future, I hope to become more confident as a developer and take on bigger challenges. For now, this website is a reflection of my learning journey. Thanks for visiting and being part of it!</p>
